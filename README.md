## About

I made this to help learn how to use Vue.js and practice working with JSON files. I am using the Random User Generator API (found [here](https://randomuser.me/)) to fill in the information.

## Usage

To view the app, you can either download and open the index.html file with any modern browser or you can visit [here](http://jperrydev.com/Contacts-viewer/).

## TODO

On my list of things to do I want to learn how to integrate google or microsoft account information so the app can be used to view your own contacts.
